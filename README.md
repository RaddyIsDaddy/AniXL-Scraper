This is a scraper to export the links AniXL hosts there anime episodes on. 
This comes with a tool to scrape anime page links, which you can then use to scrape the actual videos. 
The website uses javascript to dynamically load the episode numbers if there are more then 50 episodes. So after scraping anime page links you will need to also scrape the links for 50+ episode shows. The scripts are all provided here.
